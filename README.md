# Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch-Neural-Style-Transfer
This is a project I studied at Coursera . In this 2 hour-long project-based course, I learned  to implement neural style transfer using PyTorch..Neural Style Transfer is an optimization technique used to take a content and a style image and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image but painted in the style of the style image.Icreated artistic style image using content and given style image. We will compute the content and style loss function. I minimized this loss function using optimization techniques to get an artistic style image that retains content features and style features.
